Design and build a blog website where different users can create a blog and it's visible to everyone.

Note that:
For a users to create a blog they must have an account and are logged in.

All blog posts are visible to both authenticated and non authenticated users.

An authenticated user can create, update, and delete a single post, created by that user.

Ensure that you follow the MVC pattern.

All blogs must be saved in MongoDB.

Use bcrypt jsonwebtoken and cookies for authentication and authorization.

You must handle all errors on both signup and login forms.

Use EJS as template engine.

Good Luck!
